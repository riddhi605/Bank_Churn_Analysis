# Bank_Churn_Analysis

Project Overview 
-
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a banking context. Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical metric for banks to understand, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company. The analysis aims to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn, providing insights for proactive retention strategies.

﻿﻿Key Insights
  -
I dove into the data to understand what drives customers to leave a bank. Here are some key insights:
1️⃣ Credit Score Matters- Customers with higher credit scores (Excellent to Very Good) are less likely to leave the bank, while those with lower scores (Fair to Poor) are more prone to churn.

2️⃣ Location Plays a Role- Geography influences customer decisions. A customer's location can impact their likelihood of leaving the bank.

3️⃣ Age & Tenure- Older customers with longer tenures tend to be more loyal and are less likely to churn. Age is indeed a relevant factor.

4️⃣ Gender- Higher Churn rate observed in Female category than Male category

5️⃣ Credit Card & Activity:-Having a credit card and being an active member also contribute to retaining customers.

6️⃣ Salary Matters- Customers with higher salaries are more likely to stay with the bank.

Understanding these factors is crucial for banks, as it helps in designing effective loyalty programs and retention campaigns to retain as many customers as possible.
